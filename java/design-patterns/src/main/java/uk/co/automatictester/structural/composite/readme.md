##### Participants:
- Composite (Dir class)
- Component (also Dir class)
- Leaf (File class)
- Client (CompositeTest)

This example is (on purpose) different from the original Composite pattern described
in "Design Patternes" by GoF. The original goal is retained (to let client treat 
individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly). I believe this pattern 
in its original shape no longer matches current standards of object-oriented 
programming in Java.
