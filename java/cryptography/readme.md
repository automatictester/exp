# Cryptography

### Theory

Kerckhoff's principle:
- Cryptosystem should remain secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge
- Therefore, system may be stolen by the enemy, not causign any problems if key remains secret

Ciphers:
- Good cipher - brute force is the best possible attack
- Broken cipher - an attack substantially better than brute force exists

Security goals:
- IND (indistinguishability) - ciphertext should be indistinguishable from random sequence
- NM (non-malleability) - ciphertext cannot be transformed into another ciphertext, which decrypts to related plaintext

Semantic security:
- Also known as IND-CPA (indistinguishability - chosen plaintext attack)
- Ciphertext should reveal nothing about plaintext as long as key remains secret
- Requires encrypting the same plaintext twice to produce different ciphertext

Information-theoretic security:
- Defines purely theoretical concept of trully unbreakable cryptographic system
- Attacker, even with unlimited time and processing power, cannot get to know anything except plaintext length
- Only one such system exists - only one time pad, random key, len ( K ) >= len ( P )
- Simple, although not non-malleable example: C = P ⊕ K

Computational security:
- Attacker with limited time and processing power cannot break the cipher
- Even if you know P and C, this is still computationally secure because testing 2<sup>n</sup>, e.g. 2<sup>128</sup>
  keys would take too much time

Provable security:
- Refers to the situation when breaking the cipher is proved to be at least as hard as solving some other mathematical
  or statistical problem

Heuristic security:
- Although there is no direct relation to another hard problem, but others were unable to break the cipher
- Example: AES

### Randomness

Overview:
- Non-cryptographic PRNGs shouldn't be used in cryptography, because the focus on distribution, not predictability
- Statistical tests are useless in determining cryptographic suitability (non-predictability) of a PRNG

RNG:
- Trully random/non-deterministic
- Slow
- Based on analog resources
- Don't guarantee high levels of entropy

PRNG:
- Based on RNG (digital sources)
- Deterministic
- Offer maximum entropy
- Can be either software or hardware

PRNG types:
- Cryptographic:
  - Python `os.urandom()` and `secrets.SystemRandom` class
  - OS-level `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom`
- Non-cryptographic:
  - Very often based on Mersenne Twister
  - Python `random`

/dev/random vs /dev/urandom:
- Both are secure, although `urandom` is stronger
- `random` blocks if its estimate of entropy is too low
- For that reason, implementations based on `random` are prone to DoS
- `random` is based on entropy estimation, which is generally a challenge

PRNG algorithms:
- Yarrow:
  - Based on SHA-1 and 3DES
  - Used in iOS and macOS
  - Used by FreeBSD until they migrated to Fortune
- Fortuna:
  - Successor to Yarrow
  - Used by Windows and (currently) FreeBSD

### Symmetric-key cryptography

Overview:
- Uses same key for encryption and decryption
- Key length = level of security, 128 bit key = 128 bit security
- For a 128 bit key, every single of 2<sup>128</sup> keys is valid

Sub-categories:
- Block ciphers
- Stream ciphers

### Block Ciphers

Overview:
- Characterized by block size and key length
- Consist of multiple rounds of relatively simple operations
- Block cipher with 3 rounds:
  - C = E<sub>RK3</sub> ( E<sub>RK2</sub> ( E<sub>RK1</sub> ( P ) ) )
- Each round uses the same algorithm, but different round key, derived from main key
- Derivation of round key is called key schedule
- Key schedule is required to avoid sliding attacks
- Consequences of too large block size:
  - Longer ciphertext, due to longer padding
  - Higher memory utilisation and slower speed, if it doesn't fit into CPU register
- Too small block size = risk of code book attack

Types:
- Feistel network: early design, e.g. DES
- SP network, modern design, e.g. AES

Secure:
- AES
- 3DES

Insecure:
- DES
- GOST

### DES

- Key length: 56 bits, hence insecure from day one
- Block size: 64 bits
- Based on Feistel network
- Rounds: 16
- Optimized for dedicated hardware, not modern CPUs

### 3DES

- Secure by current standards, but slower than AES, hence no reason to use in new designs
- C = E<sub>K3</sub> ( D<sub>K2</sub> ( E<sub>K1</sub> ( P ) ) )

Keying options:
- K<sub>1</sub> ≠ K<sub>2</sub> ≠ K<sub>3</sub> - 3x 56 bit key gives 168 bits total key length, however only 112 bits
  of security due to meet-in-the-middle attacks
- K<sub>1</sub> ≠ K<sub>2</sub>, K<sub>1</sub> = K<sub>3</sub> - 2x 56 bits gives 112 bits total key length
- K<sub>1</sub> = K<sub>2</sub> = K<sub>3</sub> - same as original DES, only for compatibility reasons

### GOST

- Original name: Magma
- Developed in 1970's in Soviet Union. Initially Top Secret, downgraded to Secret in 1990, published in 1994
- Insecure, with nearly feasible attack at 2<sup>101</sup>
- Design based on Feistel network and similar to DES

| |DES|GOST|
|---|---|---|
|Key length|56 bits|256 bits|
|Block size|64 bits|64 bits|
|Rounds|16 rounds|32 rounds|

### AES

- Previous name: Rijndael
- Type: SP network
- Block size: 128 bits, or 16 bytes (matrix of 4x4 bytes)
- Operates on bytes, not bits
- Key length / rounds: 128 bit with 10 rounds, 196 bit with 12 rounds, 256 bit with 14 rounds
- With AES being a standard, AES-NI (AES New Instructions) is currently implemented by vast majority of CPUs in
  desktops, laptops, tables and mobile phones, includingIntel and AMD CPUs
- AES-NI gives 10x boost; 2 GHz CPU with AES-NI offers over 0.7 GB/s throughput (per single thread) - with 4 threads
  that would be 3 GB/s throughput 
- Used in Microsoft BitLocker and Apple FileVault 2 disc encryption
- Particular weakness - having a round key, attacker can get other round keys and main key

AES, CBC and padding:
- Defined by PKCS#7 and RFC 5652
- Padding length: between 1 byte and 1 block
- Padding depends on the number of empty bytes (not bits) in the last block:
  - 1 - 1 (decimal) is added
  - 2 - 2x 2 (decimal) is added
  - ...
  - 15 - 15x 15 (decimal) is added
  - If there are no empty bytes in the last block, i.e. when P length is a multiple of block size, another block
    filled with 16x 16 (decimal) is added. This is required to distibguish between last block ending with decimal 1
    being a padding vs actial P
- Problems with padding:
  - Increased ciphertext length
  - Prone to padding oracle attacks

CTS:
- Ciphertext stealing, an alternative to padding
- Not prone to padding oracle attacks
- Less elegant, more complex (standard defines 3 possible implementations) and less popular

### Block Cipher Modes

|Mode|Encryption|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|ECB|C = E ( P )|see <sup>2</sup>; not semantically secure|
|CBC|C = E ( P ⊕ C<sub>i-1</sub> )|see <sup>1</sup> and <sup>2</sup>|
|CFB|C = E ( C<sub>i-1</sub> ) ⊕ P|see <sup>1</sup>|
|OFB|C<sub>0</sub> = E ( IV ) ⊕ P<br> C<sub>1</sub> = E ( E ( IV )<sub>0</sub> ) ⊕ P<br>...|see <sup>1</sup>|
|CTR|C = E ( N + C ) ⊕ P|uses nonce and counter|

<sup>1</sup> - in first iteration IV is used, as there is no C<sub>i-1</sub> yet 

<sup>2</sup> - requires padding

|Mode|Encryption parallelizable|Decryption parallelizable|Random access|
|---|---|---|---|
|ECB|yes|yes|yes|
|CBC|no|yes|yes|
|CFB|no|yes|yes|
|OFB|no|no|no|
|CTR|yes|yes|yes|

### Stream ciphers

Overview:
- In the past, weaker than block ciphers and cheaper to implement in hardware
- They are closer to DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generators) than PRNG because they need to be deterministic
- While DRBG takes one input: initial value / seed, stream ciphers take two: initial value and a key
- Key is usually 128-256 bits, initial value 64-128 bits
- Initial value is similar to nonce - doesn't have to be secret but has to be unique
- General form: C = E ( K, N ) ⊕ P
- Almost all stream ciphers are based on FSR (Feedback Stream Register)
- Software stream ciphers operate on bytes or 32/64 bit words, which is more efficient on modern CPUs, which can execute
  arithmetic instructions on words as quickly as on bits

Types:
- Stateful, e.g. RC4
- Counter-based, e.g. Salsa20

Types:
- Hardware:
  - A5/1 - insecure, used in 2G telecommunications
  - Grain - secure, eSTREAM portfolio
- Software:
  - RC4 - insecure, doesn't use a nonce (!)
  - Salsa20 - secure, eSTREAM portfolio
  
### Feedback Shift Register

Overview:
- Focussed on hardware implementations
- Non-linear FSRs are more secure and contain not only XOR, but also AND and OR

Example of Linear FSR:
- Initial value: 1100
- Shift all bits one to the left
- Apply linear function f XORing all bits from previous values to calculate value of right-most bit
- Iterations:
  - 1100
  - 1000
  - 0001
  - 0011
  - 0110

### Salsa20

- Modern, counter-based stream cipher created by D. Bernstein
- State size: 512 bits (4x4 matrix of 32 bit words), including:
  - Key size: 256 bits
  - Nonce: 64 bits
  - Counter: 64 bits
- 20 rounds, hence its name
- Other variants: Salsa20/12, Salsa20/8, where 20 and 8 refer to number of rounds respectively
- Improved version is called ChaCha

### Hash Functions

- Hashing is not encryption - reversing is not only not the goal, but should be impossible
- Should not be used to store masked passwords, due to ranbow table attacks

Insecure hash functions:
- All non-cryptographic hash functions, e.g. CRC
- MD5
- SHA-1

Secure hash functions:
- SHA-2
- SHA-3
- BLAKE

Digest size:
- MD5: 128 bit (32 hex)
- SHA-1: 160 bit (40 hex)
- SHA-256 - 256 bit (64 hex)

Types:
- Based on Davies-Mayer compression function with Merkle-Damgard construction - majority of hash functions
- Based on sponge function, e.g. SHA-3

Merkle-Damgard construction:
- Apply compression function to all blocks
- Finalise
- Hash

Davies-Meyer compression function:
- H<sub>i</sub> = F ( M<sub>i</sub>, H<sub>i-1</sub> ) ⊕ H<sub>i-1</sub>
- Use IV in first iteration

### SHA-1

- Block size: 512 bits
- Padding: `[1010101|1000...0000111]`, where:
  - `101010101` is actual message
  - followed by `1`
  - followed by number of `0`'s
  - followed by `111` defining actual length of actual data in this block

### SHA-2

Overview:
- SHA-256 and SHA-512 are base algorithms, from which SHA-224 and SHA-384 are derived with only minor modifications.
- Rounds: 
  - SHA-256 (and SHA-224) - 64 rounds
  - SHA-512 (and SHA-384) - 80 rounds

Family of 4 algorithms:
- SHA-224
- SHA-256
- SHA-384
- SHA-512

### SHA-3

- Designed as a futur ealternative if SHA-2 gets broken one day
- Alternative, not a successor to SHA-2 family, because SHA-2 hasn't been broken yet
- New structure, purposefully different from SHA-2 to keep it secure even if SHA-2 gets broken one day
- Based on Keccak algorithm (sponge function)
- In contrary to older hash algorithms, not prone to length extension attacks

### Keyed Hashing

- T = MAC ( K, M ), where T stands for tag
- Benefits of MAC:
  - Integrity - without key, data cannot be changed in a way that attached tag remains valid
  - Authenticity - only party with access to the key could have generated valid tag
Types of MACs:
  - HMAC - Hash-based Message Authentication Code or Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code
    - Very popular
    - E.g. HMAC-SHA256
  - CMAC - Cipher-based Message Authentication Code:
    - Successor to CBC-MAC
    - Less popular than HMAC
    - Used e.g. in IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol
  - Dedicated MAC constucts, e.g.:
    - Poly1305:
      - Initially designed as Poly1305-AES, later decoupled
      - Currently other variants exists, including ChaCha20-Poly1305
      - Optimised for modern CPUs and large messages
      - Secure, but not as much as other types of MACs - focus on performance
      - Used by Google in Chrome, Android and Google's websites
    - SipHash:
      - Designed to prevent DoS attacks against hash tables (hash flooding)
      - Optimised for short messages
      - SipHash-x-y, e.g. SipHash-2-4 (default) - 2 is the number of rounds per message block and 4 is the number of 
        finalization rounds
      - SipHash-4-8 is 2x slower but is a good choice for conservative security

### Authenticated Encryption

- Approaches:
  - Encrypt-and-MAC (E&M):
    - Least secure:
      - MAC validation requires decrypting C
      - There is a risk that MAC will leak information about P
  - MAC-then-Encrypt (MtE):
    - Security in between the other two:
      - MAC validation requires decrypting C
      - Hiding MAC inside C prevents it leaking information about P
  - Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM):
    - Most secure:
      - MAC validation doesn't require decrypting C

Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD):
  - Currently all AE ciphers support AD
  - All use IV
  - Special cases:
    - Blank AD - AE
    - Blank P - MAC
  - Ciphers:
    - AES-GCM:
      - Most popular
      - EtM type
      - Encryption is internally based on CTR, hence parallelisable both ways
      - MAC calculation is not parallelisable
      - Entire computation is parallelisable, because MAC doesn't require entire C to start calculations
      - Recommended IV length is 96 bits (12 bytes), although other lengths are technically possible
      - Sensitive to IV reuse
      - GCM mode can work with any block cipher, but vast majority use it only in combination with AES
      - GCM stands for Galois Counter Mode
      - Produces tags of 128, 120, 112, 104 or 96 bits
      - Using tags below 128 bits is discouraged, because bit strenght reduction is worse than linear
    - OCB:
      - Offset Codebook
      - Older, faster and more simple than GCM
      - Requires a license, however since 2013 licenses are granted free of charge for non-military use
      - Less sensitive to IV reuse (but still)
    - AES-GCM-SIV:
      - Synthetic IV
      - Less sensitive to IV reuse
      - Almost as fast as pure AES-GCM
      - Cannot process streams - requires entire P to be encrypted to C

### Public Key Cryptography

- Slower, but more secure than symmetric cryptography. For this reason frequently used to establish a shared secret
  which is then used to encrypt actual communication
- Level of security < key length
- Key length < key size on disk
- In contrary to symmetric keys, not every combination of 2<sup>n</sup> bits results in a valid value which can be used 
  in public key cryptography
- Keys used in publik key cryptography are composed of a set of integers, not random sequence of bytes
- Encrypt with recipient's public key to guarantee only he can decrypt it
- Encrypt with your private key to prove authenticity

### RSA

Security of RSA:
- Security of RSA is based on difficulty of factoring problem, factoring the product of two large prime numbers: 
  n = p * q
- Fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself,
  or can be represented as the product of (2 or more) prime numbers and that, this representation is unique
- Factoring problem is a NP (nondeterministic polynomial) problem - solution can be verified, but not found, in
  polynomial time, i.e. has a complexity of O(n<sup>c</sup>)
- Prime numbers p and q must be carefully chosen to avoid numbers of certain characteristics, which could have
  catastrophical consequences for security

Operations:
- Encryption / signature verification: y = x<sup>e</sup> mod n
- Decryption / signing: x = y<sup>d</sup> mod n

Encdyption with RSA-OAEP:
- OEAP - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding
- More secure than plain RSA
- Based on PRNG

Signing with RSA-PSS:
- PPS - Probabilistic Signature Scheme
- PSS is an equivalent of OAEP for signing
- More secure than plain RSA

RSA keys:
- Both public and private keys consist of sets of integers
- Private key is contains more integers than public key
- Most important of them, shared between public and private keys, is modulus (n)
- Length of RSA key is defined by the bit length of its modulus
- Keys can be used for encryption (encryption using recipient's public key) or signing (signing with sender's
  private key)

Key generation:
- Choose 2 prime numbers p and q matching certain criteria
- Calculate n = p * q
- Calculate phi ( n ) = ( p - 1 ) * ( q - 1 )
- Calculate public exponent e, where e is a prime number such that 1 < e < phi ( n )
- Calculate private exponent d = xgcd ( e, phi ) - xgcd is extended greatest common divisor
- Optionally verify ( e * d ) mod phi = 1
- Please note phi is the only calculated value which isn't persisted in private key

Private key:
- Modulus n
- Private exponent d
- Public exponent e
- Prime numbers p and q - also referred to as prime1 and prime2
- exponent1, exponent2, coefficient - used in chinese remainder theorem to speed up operations 
  involving private key (signing and decryption)

Public key:
- Modulus n
- Public exponent e

Why public exponent e is usually 65537 (0x10001):
- Small valid values of public exponent e include: 3, 5, 17, 257 or 65537
- Early RSA implementations without proper padding were vulnerable to small exponents
- Large enough to be secure and significantly more secure than 3, small enough to be efficient in public key 
  (signature verification and encryption)
- Having small private exponent could cause security issues
- With such e, private exponent d is close to n, which then makes sense to speed up private key operations with
  chinese remainder theorem

Inspecting RSA keys with OpenSSL:
- openssl rsa -in rsa -text -noout
- openssl rsa -in rsa.pub -text -pubin -noout

### Diffie Hellman Key Exchange

Overview:
- Security of DH is based on difficulty of DLP (discreet logarithm problem)
- Requires RSA or another PK cryptography to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks

|Alice|Public|Bob|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|a|g, n|b|
|ag| |bg|
|ag, bg| |bg, ag|
|abg| |abg|

### Key Strength Comparison

RSA/DH vs symmetric key strength:
- 1024 bit RSA/DH = 80 bit symmetric
- 2048 bit RSA/DH = 112 bit symmetric
- 3072 bit RSA/DH = 128 bit symmetric
- 15360 bit RSA/DH = 256 bit symmetric

EC vs other public key strength:
- 256 bit EC = 3072 bit RSA/DH
- 384 bit EC = 7680 bit RSA/DH - currently defined as good enough for US Top Secret level

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Benefits:
- Significantly shorter key length for the same level of key strength
- Reduced storage and transmission requirements

### (Perfect) Forward Secrecy

- Compromising K<sub>x</sub> allows to decrypt messages encrypted using K<sub>x...n</sub>
  but doesn't allow to decrypt messages encrypted K<sub>0...x-1</sub> 
- DH key exchange - Forward Secrecy
- DHE key exchange (Ephemeral) - Perfect Forward Secrecy

### Security Testing Checklist

- Are keys of correct size?
- Are keys of correct type (e.g. RSA vs EC)?
- Are HKDFs supplied with correct input?
- Are PRNGs suitable for use in cryptography?
